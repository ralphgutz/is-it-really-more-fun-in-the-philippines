# Is it Really More Fun in the Philippines?: An Exploratory Data Analysis on the State of the Philippines in World Happiness Reports

The World Happiness Report is a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network that publishes annual reports of national happiness based on the ratings of each criteria. These criteria are the natural log GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy at birth, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. The main feature of the dataset is the happiness score, also referred to as Cantril life ladder, or ladder score. Respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. The report correlates the life evaluation results with other features mentioned earlier.

This analysis seeks to answer the following questions:

What is the state of the happiness score of the Philippines in the world?
What are the factors that highly affect the happiness score of the Philippines?
Does GDP per capita influence the happiness score of the Philippines? How strong is the correlation between two features?
